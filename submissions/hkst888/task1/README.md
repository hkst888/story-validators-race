  # Dear Story Admin,

  # I am hkst888!
 -I'm reaching out because I'm very interested in becoming a validator for the Story network. I’ve been following the project closely and am excited about the direction it’s heading.
- I have experience participating in testnets for networks like Voi, Laval, 0G-labs, which has given me a good understanding of the technical aspects and the dedication required for running a node. I am eager to bring my skills to the Story network and help ensure its success. 
- I would love the chance to be a part of this journey. Please let me know what steps I need to take to get involved as a validator.

# My experience:
I currently operate validator nodes for multiple blockchain networks:
- story validetor: https://testnet.story.explorers.guru/validator/040A35D437B1E3B027EC8F4448BE096B0D781D2A
- 0gchain: https://testnet.explorer.liveraven.net/zero-gravity/staking/0gvaloper1slvss60jrj92dw20d7l69eq95a2f42rkgghrte
